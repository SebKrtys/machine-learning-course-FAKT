# machine-learning-course-FAKT

The project was made as a final assingment for a machine learning course 
at Corvinus University of Budapest organized by the Society of Young 
Autonomous Economists (Fiatal Autonóm Közgazdászok Társasága - FAKT).
The task was to build an ML model to predict the online news popularity based on a UCI Online News Popularity Data Set: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thehapyone/uci-online-news-popularity-data-set/data.
With an AUC of 0.73577, my predictive model happened to be the best among the participants of the course.
